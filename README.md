# how to test it out (note:never generate real keys while online)
goto [here](https://github.com/no-development-group/PaperCut/tree/pages) and select what you want to do
# how it works
well basicly the boring thingy is like helping the main html thingy and so once the html has all its thingys witch are offline so you dont really need to worry about someone stealing your special solana important thingy but you can create wallets offline if you want extra protection but you should probably send it 5 devenet solana so it isnt an unfunded wallet (i think that is how it works but idk)
use the other thingy to use the wallet u made before (it is offlien so once you send a transaction you can bin that wallet if you really think that all the official solana js lib is gonna get u).
# why is this readme so bad
